# PlanarGraphLab
PlanarGraphLab is a visualization tool designed to help you run algorithms on planar graphs step-by-step.
With PlanarGraphLab, you can:
- [Draw a Graph](#draw-a-graph)
- [Run Algorithms on a Graph Step-by-Step](#run-algorithms)
- [Export/Import Graphs in a Special JSON Format](#json-format)

## Draw A Graph
### Creating
1. Select "Vertices"
2. Click on the canvas to place a vertex
3. Select "Edges"
4. Click on two vertices, one at a time, to add an edge


### Changing
- To move a vertex, select "Select", then click on the vertex to move and its new location on the canvas
- To delete a vertex/edge, select "Select", then click on the edge / the vertex to delete and select delete


### Predefined Graphs
1. Select "Predefined"
2. Select one of the predefined graphs

## Run Algorithms
1. Have a graph ready
2. Select "Algorithms"
3. Click on "Step" to perform a step of the algorithm or on "Run to completion" to run to completion


### Implemented Algorithms
- Triangulation
- Planar Separator
- Weight Max Matching
- Mixed Max Cut
- Max Flow
- Disjunct S-T Paths

## JSON Format
1. Select "JSON"
2. Use "Get current graph representation" to export or "Load graph from JSON" to import a graph
